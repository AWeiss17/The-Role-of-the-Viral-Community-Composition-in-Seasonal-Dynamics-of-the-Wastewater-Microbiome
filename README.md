# The Role of the Viral Community Composition in Seasonal Dynamics of the Wastewater Microbiome
This repository contains all scripts used in the data analysis for the paper - Viral and Eukaryotic Drivers of Prokaryotic and Antibiotic Resistance Gene Diversity in Wastewater Microbiomes - (DOI: to be provided). Our aim was to investigate the shaping factors of bacterial diversity to understand antibiotic resistance gene variation in the wastewater microbiome by integrating viral and ARG metagenomic data, as well as eukaryotic and prokaryotic metatranscriptomic data.
To ensure full reproducibility of the workflow, the repository includes Bash scripts for data retrieval, preprocessing, and taxonomic assignment, as well as R scripts used for statistical analyses along with visualizations. This repository contains the preprocessing of the viral dataset. The eukaryotic and prokaryotic datasets were processed in a previous study by Heck et al. (2023) and are used as input for the statistical analyses.
