# The Role of the Viral Community Composition in Seasonal Dynamics of the Wastewater Microbiome
This repository contains all scripts used in the data analysis for the paper of The Role of the Viral Community Composition in Seasonal Dynamics of the Wastewater Microbiome (DOI: to be provided). Our aim was to investigate the shaping factors of antibiotic resistance gene diversity in a wastewater microbiome by integrating viral, eukaryotic, and prokaryotic community data.
To ensure full reproducibility of the workflow, the repository includes Bash scripts for data retrieval, preprocessing, and taxonomic assignment, as well as R scripts used for statistical analyses along with visualizations. This repository contains the preprocessing of the viral dataset. The eukaryotic and prokaryotic datasets were processed in a previous study by Heck et al. (2023) and are used as input for the statistical analyses.
